                    and adapt. His fellow Argentines on the PSG squad, midfielder Leandro Paredes and winger Angel Di Maria, left the French capital this summer -- both men ended up joining Juventus, the former on loan and the latter as a free agent -- which meant Messi had to open up a bit more with the rest of the squad, which he is enjoying.
        
                    The change of manager has been a big thing too. He didn't really get on with Mauricio Pochettino but likes working with Christophe Galtier. He thinks the new system with a back three is a good idea, and he's enjoying his more central position; last year, Pochettino kept playing him wide, which he can't do anymore at his age with the same efficiency.
                    
                    This is obviously a very important year and season for him, and it's probably the biggest reason why his start of the season has been so good.

                    The Dark Forces of Football are back at it. Or should I leave it at The Super Powers of it? Oh, damn, just one sentence and I already mentioned the dreaded S-word.

The plans were first reported by David Ornstein from The Athletic last Sunday night and they went under the European radar until early on Monday morning. That was the moment echoes started reverberating and you, undoubtedly and inevitably, found yourself looking at—let’s be honest—just another of those magnifying stories of grandiose plans describing all you need to know about UEFA’s latest dream.

The 2022 Summer Hit, but it ultimately landed, indeed: the current chairman of the European Club Association (ECA) and president of French club Paris Saint-Germain, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, will lead a group of representatives pitching the idea of “taking Champions League games outside of the continent”, supposedly, “to make meaningful games more accessible to global fanbases.” That group, Ornstein wrote, includes “some of the most powerful club executives in European football” that favor that proposal.
